# possible next steps

+ bibjson2bib so we can easily import BibJSON into JabRef
+ text2bib which can import plain text formatted citation and output a BibTeX file
+ api2bib would be a tool that can talk to public APIs like CrossRef, DataCite and ORCID and render a BibTeX from the JSON API response
