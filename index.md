# bibtex golang package

[bibtex](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/bibtex) is a golang package for working with BibTeX files. 
It includes *bibfilter* which is a command line utility for filtering bib files by entry type 
(e.g. removing comments before importing into JabRef).  *bibtex* also can be compiled to 
JavaScript via GopherJS. A web version of the *bibfiter* command line utility is available in the 
[webapp](webapp/) directory. Both the command line utility and webapp use
the same *bibtex* golang package for implementation.
